This is my first public note.

I’m using this site as a digital garden: short notes, ideas in progress, and things I’m learning as I go. I obsessed over the design of this website and the workflow that will let me type this note on Typora on my Mac and upon saving the file, a Rust program automagically runs Hugo to build the site, deploys it to my web server running on Hetzner, and brings it to your eyes hot. 

Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/aravindhsampath/aravindh.net_notes) if you're curious

It was fun redesigning this site, yet again. 

Pairing up with Gemini-3.0-Pro, I learnt a lot of things along the way:

1. Transparency effects
2. Box shadow to get a Neumorphic effect
3. Fonts pre-loading
4. color palette choice - the website background involves a sane color, a large radial blur and a micro grain texture that is almost invisible to give the effect of a physical mediumm instead of the digital flatness. 

All this while keeping with the true spirit of this website - being lean, selfhosting everything including the fonts, biasing towards readability over eye candy. 

Until the next urge to redesign.... Cheers!
